## Summary of Project
This project was a mess from start to finish, and I'm not really happy with what I'm \
submitting but I have nothing else to give. I got injured and sick right when I was supposed \
to have the most time to dedicate to this, so it's very sloppily thrown together, and it works \
kind of but not really. I was at a bit of a loss as to where to actually start the project, so \
I just took the starter code we were given in lab.h and got to work on writing out those \
functions. I was able to get most of them working, with the exception of changedir. I'm not \
sure exactly what was wrong with it, but even though it was parsing the arguments correctly, I \
couldn't get it to change directories succesfully. I attempted to get some sort of main method \
written, except running ./myprogram would not actually run my main function, and it was \
frusturating trying to figure out what was wrong without being able to see what myprogram was \
actually doing. So ultimately, it's only the test lab that works, and unfortunately I don't \
have the time to improve anything else. I also have the code for setUp and tearDown commented \
out in the test lab, as for some reason when I had it there, it wouldn't show the results for \
what tests were passing and what tests were not. Again, I really don't know the reason, I \
wish I'd been able to put a little more into this project, and hopefully I don't have a \
repeat of really unfortunate circumstances for the remaining projects in the class.
